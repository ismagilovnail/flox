## CURRENT STATE — UPDATE THIS EVERY PHASE

```
CURRENT PHASE : PHASE 26 — ClickHouse
STATUS        : done — the real §48 five-table schema replaces Phase 25's
                disposable single `events` table (schema/000_drop_phase25_
                schema.sql drops it, 001-005 create click_events/
                tracking_events/conversion_events/cost_events/
                postback_events). event.Type.IsClick()/IsCPA() (new,
                exhaustive-and-disjoint, test-guarded) route each
                event_queue batch into up to 3 ClickHouse inserts via
                internal/chstore.EventStore.InsertBatch — never one insert
                per row. cost_events is schema-only (its Postgres sync is
                Phase 27-COST's job, confirmed out of scope, same pattern
                as cost_entries starting manual-only in Phase 17).
                postback_events gets REAL ingestion, both directions
                (confirmed via AskUserQuestion): internal/conversion.Service
                and internal/postback.Deliverer each report every outcome
                (not just successes) through a new AttemptLogger interface
                to internal/postbacklog — a near-duplicate of
                internal/eventqueue (own Postgres queue + Flusher) rather
                than a shared/generic implementation, deliberately, since
                the two payload shapes have nothing else in common.
                Verified end-to-end: one incoming postback produces both a
                Postgres `postbacks` row and a ClickHouse postback_events
                row, and the outgoing delivery it triggers produces its own
                postback_events row after actually hitting the network.
                Materialized views: click_events_daily_campaign,
                click_events_daily_geo (§48's two named patterns) plus
                conversion_events_daily_campaign (revenue — not named by
                §48 but the same pattern, added since CLAUDE.md #6/
                §27-COST will need it and the cost was near-zero).
                internal/analytics gained a second endpoint
                (GET .../daily-revenue) reading the new revenue aggregate.
                No TTL on any table (confirmed via AskUserQuestion — no
                retention policy exists anywhere in this project's docs;
                a silent default would be a real, possibly GDPR-relevant
                decision made by omission).
                BONUS, not originally scoped but closes a promise made in
                Phase 22/23/25 docs: attribution's MemoryResolver — which
                was NEVER actually populated by the real tracker, so EVERY
                conversion has been permanently unattributed since Phase 23
                shipped — is replaced by chstore.ClickResolver, querying
                click_events for real. Handles stickyFlowKeepClickId's
                click_id reuse (resolves to the EARLIEST occurrence) and
                excludes SOURCE_FILTER rows (never reached a destination,
                so a network could never legitimately reference one).
                Eventual-consistency caveat documented (click_events lags
                the real click by up to ~2s, the worker's flush interval).
                Best-effort at tracker startup, matching Redis's existing
                stance — falls back to MemoryResolver (attribution always
                unattributed until restart) rather than refusing to start,
                since the redirect path must never depend on ClickHouse
                being up. Verified with a REAL click through the tracker's
                /t/ endpoint, flushed to ClickHouse, then a real incoming
                postback for that exact click_id — attribution_outcome
                came back "attributed" / method "click_id", the first time
                any smoke test this session has NOT read "matched no click
                of this organization."
                69 tests pass across 8 packages (up from 39 last phase);
                full Postgres migration round-trip (00001-00016) and a
                from-scratch ClickHouse schema application both verified.
                Frontend (apps/web) untouched — Phase 27's job.
                Carried over, unrelated: Phase 10 crash-loop report; in-app
                WebView bounce (§73).
LAST COMMIT   : feat(clickhouse): five-table analytical schema
NEXT          : PHASE 26.5 — LTV & Cohort Engine — confirm before starting.
                FTD/reg cohorts, lifetime_days, LTV windows — "core value
                for iGaming, do not skip" per the spec. Likely needs its
                own ltv_events table or a materialized view over
                conversion_events; decide which before writing schema.
```

> At the end of every phase: update the four lines above, add a CHANGELOG entry,

## THE ONE RULE

**Work strictly one phase at a time.** Never build ahead. Never generate large
code before validating the current phase. Every phase follows:

```
Inspect → Plan → Implement → Run → Test → Fix → Review → Document → STOP
```

Only advance when the current phase meets its Definition of Done (§79).
Phase order is fixed — see §9. Do not reorder or skip.

---

## PHASE PROTOCOL (per §2)

Open each phase with:

```
PHASE X — NAME — GOAL
What will be built
Files created/changed
Dependencies
Acceptance criteria
```

Close each phase with:

```
COMPLETED / TESTS / KNOWN ISSUES / FILES CHANGED / NEXT PHASE
```

Run typecheck, lint, unit tests, and build where applicable before reporting
complete. Never skip validation. Do not ask permission to continue unless a real
architectural blocker exists — but never make silent destructive changes.

---

## STACK (do not swap without asking)

**Frontend:** Next.js · React · TypeScript · Tailwind · shadcn/ui · Radix ·
TanStack Query/Table · React Hook Form · Zod · Zustand · Lucide · date-fns ·
Apache ECharts.

**Backend:** Go · chi · pgx · sqlc (where sensible) · goose migrations ·
slog/zerolog · OpenTelemetry.

**Data:** PostgreSQL (control plane) · ClickHouse (high-volume events + analytics)
· Redis (cache, rate limits, sticky CACHE only, postback dedup) · S3-compatible
object storage.

**Architecture:** modular monolith. `apps/tracker` and `apps/worker` are separate
binaries inside the same Go module, sharing `internal/routing` and
`internal/classifier`. No microservices up front. No unnecessary frameworks.

## REPO LAYOUT

```

Frontend internal structure: `app/ components/ features/ hooks/ lib/ stores/
types/ schemas/`. Domain code lives in `features/`. All server calls go through
`src/lib/api` — never scatter `fetch()` in components (§32, §70).

Go structure per module: `handler → service → repository → domain`. Handlers are
thin; business logic never lives in handlers or in React components (§34, §71).

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE INVARIANTS

Read the referenced section before touching related code.

1. **Single source of truth for routing (§6-SHARED, §26).** Routing/filter/sticky
   /metric decision logic exists ONCE (in Go). The routing simulator is a thin UI
   over the `/routing/simulate` contract — NOT a second TS implementation. Both
   sides pass one shared conformance fixture.

2. **Full event model (§43).** ~20 event types incl. CPA statuses
   HOLD/ACCEPT/REDEP/DECLINE/TRASH as an enum. Design the ClickHouse schema for
   all of them from day one — adding types later is a live-data migration. Never
   collapse conversions into one "conversion" type.

3. **Postback dedup key = (click_id, status, event_ref)** (§45) — NOT click_id
   alone, and NOT (click_id, status). `event_ref` = network txn id for CPA_REDEP
   (the only repeatable status), empty string for every other status even if a
   txn id was sent. **Status never goes back to CPA_HOLD** — nightly partner
   replays re-send it after approval and would take revenue out of a closed
   report (§45 STATUS PROGRESSION). Long Redis TTL + durable DB unique
   constraint. Store original currency + USD value at event time.
   `acceptDuplicates` override per network — it does not bypass the
   progression rule.

4. **Sticky = cookie is truth, Redis is cache only (§39-STICKY).** Cookie
   `sf_{campaignId}` = `setId:flowId[:clickId]`. Redis-only sticky is forbidden
   (silently corrupts A/B tests).

5. **Tenant isolation (§36-TENANCY).** Every tenant-scoped table has
   `organization_id`; every query filters on it; enforcement is in the repository
   layer. `organization_id` comes from the session/API key, never the request
   body. ClickHouse sort keys lead with it. Cross-tenant isolation test is part of
   DoD for API/data phases.

6. **Cost or it doesn't exist (§27-COST).** Profit/ROI/ROAS need spend. Manual
   cost entry first; FB/TikTok import later. No cost for a slice → show ROI as
   "—", never compute against zero.

7. **Currency at event time (§50-FX).** Normalize to USD using the rate on the
   event date, never the current rate. Store both original and USD.

8. **Regex = RE2 only (§5, §22).** Go stdlib `regexp`. Validate user patterns at
   save time, never on the hot path. No PCRE libs.

9. **Redirect hot path stays fast (§41, §56).** tracking p50 < 20ms / p95 < 50ms
   (excl. third-party latency). Persist events async (buffered batch → queue).
   Never run analytics queries or block on outbound partner calls in the redirect.

10. **WebView bounce ≠ moderator cloaking (§73).** Bouncing in-app WebView
    (FB/IG/TikTok/Telegram) to the external browser so the PWA install prompt can
    fire is a REQUIRED, provider-neutral capability. Vendor-specific moderator
    detection is FORBIDDEN. Keep them separate.

11. **Providers behind interfaces (§74–75).** Geo, ASN, bot, cost, conversion,
    pixel, registrar, DNS, FX — all swappable. No vendor lock-in in core logic.

12. **Custom metrics build on the registry, safely (§30.5, §50).** User formulas
    reference registry metrics by stable id; division-by-zero yields empty, never
    an error; one formula = one data source (no mixing push with regular); LTV not
    allowed in formulas; team-private.

## EVENT MODEL QUICK REF (authoritative list in §43)

```
SOURCE_CLICK, SOURCE_FILTER
LAND_VIEW, LAND_CLICK, POSTLANDING_VIEW, POSTLANDING_CLICK
PWA_VIEW, PWA_OPEN, PWA_INSTALL, IOS_INSTALL
NOTIFICATION_REQUEST/SUBSCRIBE/DECLINE/UNSUBSCRIBE/CLICK
TG_JOIN, TG_START
CPA_HOLD, CPA_ACCEPT, CPA_REDEP, CPA_DECLINE, CPA_TRASH
```

Canonical funnel: `SOURCE_CLICK → LAND_VIEW → LAND_CLICK → PWA_VIEW →
PWA_INSTALL → CPA_HOLD → CPA_ACCEPT → CPA_REDEP`. Chain linked by one click_id.

---

## ROUTING QUICK REF (full detail §21, §39)

```
Campaign → Stream Set (priority, first match wins, AND/OR filters, pixels)
        → Flow (weighted, pickWeighted) → destination
No set matches → campaign fallback / safe destination.
```

`pickWeighted` is **deterministic by visit key** (§38): an unseeded FNV-1a hash
of a stable property of the visit, never an RNG. Same visit → same flow on every
replica and after every restart. Independent of sticky — the cookie is still the
truth for a returning visitor (#4); the hash covers what happens before a cookie
exists. Candidates are filtered *before* the draw, so weights mean what the
operator typed.

Decisions must be explainable: why matched / why not / why this flow / why
fallback / sticky applied from where (§72).

---

## BUILD ORDER (frontend-first, §9 / §83)

Design & UI on mock contracts first (phases 2–15), then Go backend & engines
(16+), then integration (27), then LTV (26.5), auth/RBAC (28), hardening.
"Frontend-first" means UI/UX first on mock CONTRACTS — it does NOT license a
parallel routing engine in TS.

New in v3 (secondary, after core): Tags (14.5), Custom Metrics (14.6), Report
Presets + directory stats (14.7), Referral (14.8), Content Gallery (14.9).

Core workflows to prioritize (§84): Create Campaign → Stream Set → Filters →
Flow → Simulate Routing → Analytics → Track Conversion (HOLD→ACCEPT→REDEP) →
Postback → LTV.

---

## UX FLOOR (every screen, §63–68)

loading / empty / error / success states on everything. Destructive actions
confirm. Forms validate with inline errors + disabled submit + success feedback.
Tables: sort, paginate, column visibility/resize, search, filter, export;
virtualize large sets. Dark-first, dense, tabular numerals, meaningful status
colors — a trading-terminal control plane, not a generic admin dashboard.
WCAG 2.2 AA. Animation sparing (150–250ms ease-out).

---

## DEFINITION OF DONE (§79)

```
✓ implemented        ✓ no TS errors      ✓ no Go build errors
✓ lint passes        ✓ tests pass        ✓ build passes
✓ UX reviewed        ✓ responsive        ✓ loading/empty/error states
✓ tenant isolation verified (API/data phases)
✓ docs updated       ✓ CHANGELOG entry   ✓ CLAUDE.md CURRENT STATE updated
✓ logical commit (§78)
```

---

## NEVER (§80)

Build all phases at once · replace repo without inspection · duplicate business
logic (esp. a 2nd routing impl in TS) · hardcode secrets · commit `.env` · skip
tests/validation · ignore TS/Go errors · fake APIs that look real · hide errors ·
dedup on click_id alone or on (click_id, status) alone · record a postback that
moves a conversion back to CPA_HOLD · treat missing cost as zero · Redis-only sticky ·
truncate the event model · leak data across orgs · embed vendor moderator
detection · divide-by-zero into an error in custom metrics · mix push+regular
metrics in one formula · reimplement tags per entity · treat empty FB subs as
"unknown campaign".

Mocks are allowed only in frontend-first phases and must implement the same
contract as the real backend, and be explicitly replaceable.

---

## COMMITS (§78)

Logical, per-phase commits. Examples:
`feat(ui): design system` · `feat(routing): filter builder` ·
`feat(routing): sticky engine` · `feat(ltv): cohort engine` ·
`feat(api): campaign endpoints` · `feat(tracker): tracking endpoint`.
No single giant commit.

---

## SESSION START CHECKLIST

1. Read CURRENT STATE above.
2. Read the relevant §sections in `FLOX-master-prompt-v3.md` for this phase.
3. Confirm the phase plan (§2) before writing code.
4. Implement → validate → document → update CURRENT STATE → commit → STOP.

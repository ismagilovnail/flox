## CURRENT STATE — UPDATE THIS EVERY PHASE

```
CURRENT PHASE : PHASE (unnumbered) — Wire Routing Simulator to
                /routing/simulate
STATUS        : done — direct instruction, no scope negotiation needed
                (user picked this exact candidate from the prior phase's
                own NEXT list). New apps/internal/routingsimulate package:
                Service.Simulate loads a campaign's real config via
                routingstore.LoadRoutingConfig and calls
                routing.Engine.Explain (never Resolve — the simulator's
                whole point is the trace Resolve doesn't return), mounted
                as POST /campaigns/{campaignId}/routing/simulate. No new
                routing decision logic anywhere (CLAUDE.md #1) — this
                phase is a thin reshape of an already-existing pure
                evaluation into JSON. routing.Explanation gained one field
                (DestinationLabel, the human label resolveDestination
                already computed internally but discarded) and
                Trace/StreamSetEvaluation/FlowCandidate gained JSON tags
                matching the frontend's field names exactly, reused
                directly with no separate DTO layer. Sticky is never
                simulated (always Sticky: nil — a fabricated cookie would
                be indistinguishable from a real returning visitor's,
                which is misleading for a debugging tool); the response's
                stickyNote is generated from the campaign's real
                sticky_flow flag instead of the old mock's static,
                increasingly-stale string. deriveVisitKey is reimplemented
                byte-for-byte in Go; an all-empty request against a
                multi-flow tie now surfaces as a real 422
                (routing.ErrNoVisitKey), not silently guessed.
                Frontend: lib/routing-simulate.ts (the mock) deleted
                outright — its types moved into lib/api/routing.ts, the
                seam file built in an earlier phase specifically for this
                swap ("Phase 27 only ever changes this file's body," now
                true). routing-simulator-view.tsx dropped its
                useStreamSetsStore read; simulator-form.tsx/stream-set-
                trace.tsx needed only an import-path change (both already
                pure/prop-driven); simulator-result.tsx dropped the
                selectedFlow boolean check (now flowCandidates.some(c =>
                c.selected)) and the kind-keyed DESTINATION_LABEL lookup
                (now renders destination.label directly — the backend
                already sends the exact display string). Once the
                Simulator stopped reading stores/stream-sets.ts and
                lib/mock/stream-sets.ts, a repo-wide grep found zero
                remaining importers of either — both deleted outright
                (this session's "drop it, don't fake it" precedent),
                not left as an orphaned pair.
                Two real bugs caught during manual browser verification,
                both the same root mistake hit twice: Go's encoding/json
                omitempty omits ANY zero-length slice, nil or not, not
                just nil ones. (1) routingsimulate.Response.FlowCandidates
                was nil (no draw ran) when no stream set matched, encoding
                as JSON null and crashing SimulatorResult's unconditional
                .some() call — fixed by normalizing to []
                in Service.Simulate. (2) routing.Trace.Children and
                streamset.FilterNode.Children both had omitempty; an empty
                top-level filter group ("no filters — matches all
                traffic," a normal UI-documented config) produces a real
                non-nil empty Children that omitempty hid anyway —
                crashing not just the Simulator but the Stream Sets card
                on ANY campaign with an empty-filter stream set, since
                hydrateFilterNode/FilterTraceView call .map()/.length on
                children unconditionally. Fixed by dropping omitempty from
                both types' Children tags. Neither bug was reachable in
                any prior phase's verification pass because no earlier
                test fixture had exercised an empty root filter group
                through a real HTTP round-trip. See
                docs/routing-simulate.md for full detail on both.
                Verified: go build/vet/gofmt/test ./... all green (5 new
                routingsimulate tests, 2 new regression tests for the
                omitempty bug in streamset/routing, the pre-existing
                18-case routing conformance fixture unchanged); tsc
                --noEmit and eslint clean; full manual browser pass —
                matched and non-matched filter simulation, weighted
                50/50 tie-break with a deterministic pick, sticky-enabled
                note toggling live against a real Postgres update, both
                bugs caught and fixed in the same pass. Test campaign
                (cascading to its stream set), offer, and network removed
                via real DELETE afterward.
                Phase 27's remaining gap (conversions/postbacks, the
                /analytics report builder, /ltv-cohorts) is unchanged —
                Traffic Sources, Networks, Offers, Stream Sets/Filters/
                Flows, and the Routing Simulator are all off that list
                now, see docs/frontend-integration.md.
LAST COMMIT   : feat(routing): wire Routing Simulator to /routing/simulate
NEXT          : confirm scope before starting. Candidates: FB/TikTok
                ad-spend import (§74's CostProvider interface, the "later"
                half of §27-COST), Landing/PWA/Postlanding/Pixels CRUD
                (would unblock the stages the Stream Sets phase had to
                drop from the Flow editor), or the next domain slice
                (Conversions/Postbacks — both still fully mocked).
```

> At the end of every phase: update the four lines above, add a CHANGELOG entry,

## THE ONE RULE

**Work strictly one phase at a time.** Never build ahead. Never generate large
code before validating the current phase. Every phase follows:

```
Inspect → Plan → Implement → Run → Test → Fix → Review → Document → STOP
```

Only advance when the current phase meets its Definition of Done (§79).
Phase order is fixed — see §9. Do not reorder or skip.

---

## PHASE PROTOCOL (per §2)

Open each phase with:

```
PHASE X — NAME — GOAL
What will be built
Files created/changed
Dependencies
Acceptance criteria
```

Close each phase with:

```
COMPLETED / TESTS / KNOWN ISSUES / FILES CHANGED / NEXT PHASE
```

Run typecheck, lint, unit tests, and build where applicable before reporting
complete. Never skip validation. Do not ask permission to continue unless a real
architectural blocker exists — but never make silent destructive changes.

---

## STACK (do not swap without asking)

**Frontend:** Next.js · React · TypeScript · Tailwind · shadcn/ui · Radix ·
TanStack Query/Table · React Hook Form · Zod · Zustand · Lucide · date-fns ·
Apache ECharts.

**Backend:** Go · chi · pgx · sqlc (where sensible) · goose migrations ·
slog/zerolog · OpenTelemetry.

**Data:** PostgreSQL (control plane) · ClickHouse (high-volume events + analytics)
· Redis (cache, rate limits, sticky CACHE only, postback dedup) · S3-compatible
object storage.

**Architecture:** modular monolith. `apps/tracker` and `apps/worker` are separate
binaries inside the same Go module, sharing `internal/routing` and
`internal/classifier`. No microservices up front. No unnecessary frameworks.

Frontend internal structure: `app/ components/ features/ hooks/ lib/ stores/
types/ schemas/`. Domain code lives in `features/`. All server calls go through
`src/lib/api` — never scatter `fetch()` in components (§32, §70).

Go structure per module: `handler → service → repository → domain`. Handlers are
thin; business logic never lives in handlers or in React components (§34, §71).

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE INVARIANTS

Read the referenced section before touching related code.

1. **Single source of truth for routing (§6-SHARED, §26).** Routing/filter/sticky
   /metric decision logic exists ONCE (in Go). The routing simulator is a thin UI
   over the `/routing/simulate` contract — NOT a second TS implementation. Both
   sides pass one shared conformance fixture.

2. **Full event model (§43).** ~20 event types incl. CPA statuses
   HOLD/ACCEPT/REDEP/DECLINE/TRASH as an enum. Design the ClickHouse schema for
   all of them from day one — adding types later is a live-data migration. Never
   collapse conversions into one "conversion" type.

3. **Postback dedup key = (click_id, status, event_ref)** (§45) — NOT click_id
   alone, and NOT (click_id, status). `event_ref` = network txn id for CPA_REDEP
   (the only repeatable status), empty string for every other status even if a
   txn id was sent. **Status never goes back to CPA_HOLD** — nightly partner
   replays re-send it after approval and would take revenue out of a closed
   report (§45 STATUS PROGRESSION). Long Redis TTL + durable DB unique
   constraint. Store original currency + USD value at event time.
   `acceptDuplicates` override per network — it does not bypass the
   progression rule.

4. **Sticky = cookie is truth, Redis is cache only (§39-STICKY).** Cookie
   `sf_{campaignId}` = `setId:flowId[:clickId]`. Redis-only sticky is forbidden
   (silently corrupts A/B tests).

5. **Tenant isolation (§36-TENANCY).** Every tenant-scoped table has
   `organization_id`; every query filters on it; enforcement is in the repository
   layer. `organization_id` comes from the session/API key, never the request
   body. ClickHouse sort keys lead with it. Cross-tenant isolation test is part of
   DoD for API/data phases.

6. **Cost or it doesn't exist (§27-COST).** Profit/ROI/ROAS need spend. Manual
   cost entry first; FB/TikTok import later. No cost for a slice → show ROI as
   "—", never compute against zero.

7. **Currency at event time (§50-FX).** Normalize to USD using the rate on the
   event date, never the current rate. Store both original and USD.

8. **Regex = RE2 only (§5, §22).** Go stdlib `regexp`. Validate user patterns at
   save time, never on the hot path. No PCRE libs.

9. **Redirect hot path stays fast (§41, §56).** tracking p50 < 20ms / p95 < 50ms
   (excl. third-party latency). Persist events async (buffered batch → queue).
   Never run analytics queries or block on outbound partner calls in the redirect.

10. **WebView bounce ≠ moderator cloaking (§73).** Bouncing in-app WebView
    (FB/IG/TikTok/Telegram) to the external browser so the PWA install prompt can
    fire is a REQUIRED, provider-neutral capability. Vendor-specific moderator
    detection is FORBIDDEN. Keep them separate.

11. **Providers behind interfaces (§74–75).** Geo, ASN, bot, cost, conversion,
    pixel, registrar, DNS, FX — all swappable. No vendor lock-in in core logic.

12. **Custom metrics build on the registry, safely (§30.5, §50).** User formulas
    reference registry metrics by stable id; division-by-zero yields empty, never
    an error; one formula = one data source (no mixing push with regular); LTV not
    allowed in formulas; team-private.

---

## EVENT MODEL QUICK REF (authoritative list in §43)

```
SOURCE_CLICK, SOURCE_FILTER
LAND_VIEW, LAND_CLICK, POSTLANDING_VIEW, POSTLANDING_CLICK
PWA_VIEW, PWA_OPEN, PWA_INSTALL, IOS_INSTALL
NOTIFICATION_REQUEST/SUBSCRIBE/DECLINE/UNSUBSCRIBE/CLICK
TG_JOIN, TG_START
CPA_HOLD, CPA_ACCEPT, CPA_REDEP, CPA_DECLINE, CPA_TRASH
```

Canonical funnel: `SOURCE_CLICK → LAND_VIEW → LAND_CLICK → PWA_VIEW →
PWA_INSTALL → CPA_HOLD → CPA_ACCEPT → CPA_REDEP`. Chain linked by one click_id.

---

## ROUTING QUICK REF (full detail §21, §39)

```
Campaign → Stream Set (priority, first match wins, AND/OR filters, pixels)
        → Flow (weighted, pickWeighted) → destination
No set matches → campaign fallback / safe destination.
```

`pickWeighted` is **deterministic by visit key** (§38): an unseeded FNV-1a hash
of a stable property of the visit, never an RNG. Same visit → same flow on every
replica and after every restart. Independent of sticky — the cookie is still the
truth for a returning visitor (#4); the hash covers what happens before a cookie
exists. Candidates are filtered *before* the draw, so weights mean what the
operator typed.

Decisions must be explainable: why matched / why not / why this flow / why
fallback / sticky applied from where (§72).

---

## BUILD ORDER (frontend-first, §9 / §83)

Design & UI on mock contracts first (phases 2–15), then Go backend & engines
(16+), then integration (27), then LTV (26.5), auth/RBAC (28), hardening.
"Frontend-first" means UI/UX first on mock CONTRACTS — it does NOT license a
parallel routing engine in TS.

New in v3 (secondary, after core): Tags (14.5), Custom Metrics (14.6), Report
Presets + directory stats (14.7), Referral (14.8), Content Gallery (14.9).

Core workflows to prioritize (§84): Create Campaign → Stream Set → Filters →
Flow → Simulate Routing → Analytics → Track Conversion (HOLD→ACCEPT→REDEP) →
Postback → LTV.

---

## UX FLOOR (every screen, §63–68)

loading / empty / error / success states on everything. Destructive actions
confirm. Forms validate with inline errors + disabled submit + success feedback.
Tables: sort, paginate, column visibility/resize, search, filter, export;
virtualize large sets. Dark-first, dense, tabular numerals, meaningful status
colors — a trading-terminal control plane, not a generic admin dashboard.
WCAG 2.2 AA. Animation sparing (150–250ms ease-out).

---

## DEFINITION OF DONE (§79)

```
✓ implemented        ✓ no TS errors      ✓ no Go build errors
✓ lint passes        ✓ tests pass        ✓ build passes
✓ UX reviewed        ✓ responsive        ✓ loading/empty/error states
✓ tenant isolation verified (API/data phases)
✓ docs updated       ✓ CHANGELOG entry   ✓ CLAUDE.md CURRENT STATE updated
✓ logical commit (§78)
```

---

## NEVER (§80)

Build all phases at once · replace repo without inspection · duplicate business
logic (esp. a 2nd routing impl in TS) · hardcode secrets · commit `.env` · skip
tests/validation · ignore TS/Go errors · fake APIs that look real · hide errors ·
dedup on click_id alone or on (click_id, status) alone · record a postback that
moves a conversion back to CPA_HOLD · treat missing cost as zero · Redis-only sticky ·
truncate the event model · leak data across orgs · embed vendor moderator
detection · divide-by-zero into an error in custom metrics · mix push+regular
metrics in one formula · reimplement tags per entity · treat empty FB subs as
"unknown campaign".

Mocks are allowed only in frontend-first phases and must implement the same
contract as the real backend, and be explicitly replaceable.

---

## COMMITS (§78)

Logical, per-phase commits. Examples:
`feat(ui): design system` · `feat(routing): filter builder` ·
`feat(routing): sticky engine` · `feat(ltv): cohort engine` ·
`feat(api): campaign endpoints` · `feat(tracker): tracking endpoint`.
No single giant commit.

---

2. Read the relevant §sections in `FLOX-master-prompt-v3.md` for this phase.
3. Confirm the phase plan (§2) before writing code.
4. Implement → validate → document → update CURRENT STATE → commit → STOP.
